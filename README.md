### UCP
We propose a uniform channel pruning (UCP) method to prune deep convolutional neural networks, and the modified squeeze-and-excitation blocks (MSEB) is used to measure the importance of the channels in the convolutional layers. The unimportant channels (feature maps), including convolutional kernels related to them, are pruned directly, which greatly reduces the storage cost and number of calculations. The framework of proposed UCP is as follows:
